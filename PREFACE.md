# Preface

I've prepared this video / repo to:

## Main points:

- Demonstrate my genuine enthusiasm for this role and address any concerns about my long-term commitment to this important position
- Provide insight into what you can expect from me beyond the initial take-home assignment (I consistently deliver above expectations and have the results to prove it)
- Highlight my rare expertise in managing complex migrations both safely and efficiently - with my experience, I suspect that I can potentially reduce the migration timeline to 6-12 months, creating more opportunity to deliver additional value
- Showcase my passion for creating educational content that has lasting impact and accelerates the skill development of team members
- Worst case scenario, you get some free code / advice that you can use to help you in the future
